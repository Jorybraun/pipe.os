## [Unreleased]

### Added — Repo Decomposition into repo_nodes (Phase 2)

- **Migration `0050_repo_nodes.sql`**: addressable sub-element decomposition for Pass 3 repos. Table `repo_nodes` with 9-type `CHECK` constraint (`Feature`, `ArchitecturalPattern`, `TechnicalStack`, `Construct`, `ChallengeSurface`, `QualitySignal`, `DomainContext`, `PRSample`, `IssueCandidate`), indexes on `(repo_id, node_type)` and `(repo_id, signals_version)`, and dual-layer `embedding_json` per ADR-040.
- **`workers/api/scripts/crawl-repos/pass3/run.ts`**: Pass 3 prompt now asks Gemma to produce structured `sub_elements` JSON alongside the 9 legacy top-level fields. Zod schema (`pass3GemmaOutputSchema`) validates Gemma output before any D1 write. `PRSample` and `IssueCandidate` sub-elements are derived deterministically from existing `repo_sample_prs` and `repo_issues` rows (no Gemma call). Each sub-element gets a BGE-large-en-v1.5 embedding (type-prefixed narrative, document side) and is upserted to `REPO_INDEX` with metadata `{entity_type:'repo', entity_id, node_type, signals_version, admin_status:'approved'}`.
- **`workers/api/scripts/crawl-repos/pass3/persist.ts`**: `persistRepoNodes` performs transactional delete+insert per repo, pre-generates embeddings before D1 write, and batches inserts. `upsertRepoNodesToVectorize` sends batched NDJSON upserts to Vectorize.
- **`workers/api/scripts/backfillRepoNodes.ts`**: backfill script for existing `pass >= 3` repos. Queries repos lacking `repo_nodes`, uses a cheaper Gemma extraction prompt against existing `engineering_narrative` to avoid full Pass 3 re-runs, appends PR/Issue sub-elements, and persists embeddings + Vectorize upserts. Supports `--dry-run`, `--batch=N`, and `--repo-id=<id>`.

### Added — PR Narrative Enrichment & Semantic Selection

- **Migration `0051_repo_sample_prs_narrative.sql`**: adds `pr_narrative`, `pr_narrative_embedding_json`, and `pr_narrative_version` to `repo_sample_prs`.
- **`workers/api/scripts/crawl-repos/pass2/prNarrative.ts`**: new module that generates a Gemma-derived 2–3 sentence narrative per sampled PR (grounded in changed files, constructs, and PR metadata) and embeds it via BGE-large-en-v1.5 (document side).
- **`workers/api/scripts/crawl-repos/index.ts`**: Pass 2 now auto-chains PR narrative enrichment after sampling. Non-fatal: individual PR failures are logged and the original PR is persisted unchanged.
- **`workers/api/scripts/crawl-repos/pass2/persist.ts`**: persists the three new narrative columns into `repo_sample_prs`.
- **`workers/api/src/lib/match/autoStageBuilder.ts`**: `pickReviewPr()` now supports semantic selection. When a candidate embedding is provided, it computes exact cosine similarity between the candidate profile and each PR's narrative embedding, returning the best match above threshold 0.6. Falls back to the existing `ORDER BY changed_file_count ASC` when no embedding is available, no PR clears the threshold, or embeddings are missing. Logs `selectionPath` (`semantic` vs `size_fallback`) for observability.
- **`workers/api/src/lib/match/matchReposForCandidate.ts`**: accepts optional `candidateEmbeddingJson` and forwards it to `pickReviewPr()`.
- **`workers/api/src/lib/candidateDiscovery/orchestrate.ts`**: loads the candidate embedding from `candidate_ingestion.embedding_json` early and passes it through to `matchReposForCandidate` and the re-rank `pickReviewPr` call.
- **`workers/api/scripts/crawl-repos/pass3/run.ts`**: `callGemma()` now accepts an optional `responseMimeType` parameter (default `application/json`) to support plaintext PR narrative generation.

### Added — Unified Agent Runtime (ADR-034)

- `workers/api/src/lib/unifiedAgentRuntime/`: shared FSM, plugin registry, session store, scorer, eval gate, and provider for role discovery, code review, and culture interview agents.
- `workers/api/src/lib/agents/{roleDiscovery,codeReview,culture}/plugin.ts`: per-agent plugins registered via `registerAllPlugins()`.
- `workers/api/src/routes/agents.ts`: unified `/api/v1/agents/*` routes (mounted in `index.ts`).
- `migration/0043_agent_sessions.sql`: unified `agent_sessions` table for cross-agent operational queries.
- `docs/decisions/current/ADR-034-unified-agent-runtime.md`: rationale and consolidation plan.

### Added — RCD Decomposition into role_nodes (Phase 2)

- `workers/api/src/lib/roleAgent/decomposeRcd.ts`: pure extractor `decomposeRcdIntoNodes` turns a `RoleContextDocument` into 11 typed `RoleNodeRow` sub-elements (Requirement, Responsibility, CulturalSignal, TeamContext, Dealbreaker, RedFlag, TechnicalContext, CodebaseExpectation, ProcessExpectation, Conflict, BarsOverride). Each node carries type-prefixed narrative text, structured `extracted_properties_json`, stakeholder attribution, and must/nice weights.
- `persistRoleNodes` in `decomposeRcd.ts`: batched BGE embedding generation, Vectorize `ROLE_INDEX` upsert with metadata, and D1 `role_nodes` INSERT via `db.batch`. Existing nodes for the same `role_context_id` are marked superseded before new ones are written.
- `workers/api/src/routes/discovery/roleContexts.ts`: post-RCD-write hook calls `decomposeRcdIntoNodes` + `persistRoleNodes` in all three synthesis call sites. Errors are caught and logged without failing synthesis.
- `workers/api/src/lib/roleAgent/__tests__/decomposeRcd.test.ts`: 7 Vitest unit tests covering full-population node counts, null-section safety, single-stakeholder extraction, type-prefix narratives, must/nice weight assignment, and meaningful `source_section` paths.

### Added — Role Discovery Evaluator

- `workers/api/src/lib/roleDiscovery/evaluator.ts` + `evaluatorPrompt.ts`: eval-gated question generation (interviewer proposes 2 candidates → evaluator picks the best) for the role discovery agent.
- `workers/api/src/routes/internal/evaluateDiscovery.ts`: internal endpoint for evaluator runs.
- `workers/api/src/lib/roleAgentPrompts.ts`: prompt rewrite to align with the evaluator contract.

### Added — Strategy & Planning Docs

- `knowledge/plan/pipe-strategy-v2-part{1..6}.md`: north-star, role discovery, repo ingestion, candidate ingestion, matching migration, and market research.
- `docs/plans/2026-04-22-eval-gated-pipeline.md`, `docs/plans/2026-04-22-live-rcd-synthesis.md`.
- `docs/handoffs/{discovery-agent-context,phase-2-role-discovery-migration,unified-agent-runtime}-2026-04-23.md`.
- `scripts/research-vector-signals.py`: research helper for vector-native signal exploration.

### Changed

- `migration/PLAN.md`: Phase 5 marked done (Terraform dropped per ADR-041, GitHub Actions live, `amplify/` deleted); Phase 3 marked drifted; Workers route inventory updated to 34 modules; D1 migration count updated to 0001–0042.
- `CLAUDE.md`: added Context Budget section enforcing per-session limits on project files, skills, and persistent memory.

### Removed

- `data/experiments/runs.jsonl` (stale experiment log).
- `knowledge/README.md` (superseded by `knowledge/STRATEGY.md` and the wiki).

### Fixed

- **Cross-tenant leak on `/api/v1/search/roles`:** `matchRolesVectorNative` now joins `pipelines` and filters by `owner_id`; `/roles` handler passes the authenticated user through. Mirrors the existing `matchCandidatesVectorNative` pattern.
- **Silent data corruption in CODE_REVIEW lazy-session INSERT:** `/rpc/review/ask` now derives `implementer_persona` and `max_rounds` from challenge config instead of writing literal `'pending'` into `implementer_persona`.
- **Prop mutation in `ReviewSessionReport`:** rescore now updates a local `localStatus` state instead of mutating `props.session.status`; added optional `onRescore` callback so parents can re-fetch.
- **Duplicate `review-session-loader` test-id:** init-phase loader renamed to `review-session-init-loader`; rounds-phase keeps `review-session-loader`.
- **Missing error state on CODE_REVIEW init:** `CandidateAssessmentPage` now captures init errors and renders a retry button instead of leaving the candidate stuck on a silent loader.

### Changed

- Extracted shared scoring + propagation into `workers/api/src/lib/review/scoreAndPropagate.ts`; `finalizeReviewSession` (in `review.ts`) and `POST /:sessionId/rescore` (in `reviewSessions.ts`) reduce to a single invocation wrapped in `c.executionCtx.waitUntil(...)`. `/rescore` now sets status to `'scoring'` and returns `{ success: true, status: 'scoring' }` immediately, preventing wall-time timeouts on long transcripts.
- Extracted `REVIEW_SESSION_STATUS_COLORS`/`STATUS_LABELS` to `src/lib/reviewSessionStatus.ts` and updated both consumers.
- Review Session Report modal and `GapFillModal` now expose `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, labelled heading, and Escape-to-close.
- Telemetry in `orchestrate.ts` is prefixed `[orchestrate]` and drops the redundant intersection cast on `triangulated.raw_signals`.
- Dropped duplicate `challengeId` from the `reviewSession` payload on `GET /rpc/get-challenge` (clients use the top-level `id`).
- Replaced `as unknown as ChallengeConfigRow` casts in `review.ts` with typed `.all<ChallengeConfigRow>()`.
- `roleContextsCalibrate.test.ts` now imports `Context`/`Next` from `hono` instead of typing middleware as `any`.

### Added — Test Environment Infrastructure

- `[env.test]` block in `workers/api/wrangler.jsonc` (bindings commented pending one-time bootstrap).
- `workers/api/scripts/bootstrap-test-env.sh` — creates `pipe-db-test`, `pipe-assets-test`, and three `*-profiles-test` Vectorize indexes.
- `workers/api/scripts/reset-test-db.sql` + `seed-test-db.sql` — idempotent wipe + fixture seed.
- `workers/api/scripts/TEST-ENV.md` — operator runbook.
- `.github/workflows/e2e-test.yml` — apply migrations, deploy worker + Pages, reset/seed, run Playwright serial against real backend.

### Added

**Task B — Role Discovery Agent:**
- Role Discovery agent now uses 6 calibrated probes instead of open-ended Six Domains exploration
- Role Context Document (RCD) is now the primary synthesis artifact
- Added calibration review UI for recruiters to flag and correct RCD attributes
- Added gap-filling agent for targeted clarifying questions
- **Migration `0049_role_nodes.sql`**: derivative sub-element view of RCDs; FK to `role_contexts` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`, 11-type `CHECK` constraint, and partial index on active (`superseded_at IS NULL`) nodes.

**Task C — Code Review Golden Path:**
- CODE_REVIEW stages now create review session on stage entry
- New review session endpoints: `/rpc/review/session/init`, `/message`, `/complete`
- Added dedicated review session page with diff + chat interface
- Recruiter dashboard now shows review session status, score, and transcript

**Infrastructure & Docs:**
- Phase 5 CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflows for CI, staging deploy, and production deploy
- ADR-041: Cloudflare-native deployment with Wrangler (drops Terraform)
- `workers/api/wrangler.jsonc` environments: `staging` and `production`
- `docs/project-brief.md`: Unified project vision, glossary, phased roadmap, and honest current-state snapshot
- `.claude/rules/terminology.md`: Mandatory domain language for all agents
- **Dual-layer embedding architecture (D1 ground truth + Vectorize ANN):** Migration `0042_embedding_json.sql` adds `embedding_json` to `candidate_ingestion`, `repo_engineering_signals`, and `role_contexts`; `role_contexts.role_searchable_profile` stores role narrative. Enables exact cosine computation and index rebuilds from D1.
- **Exact `role_candidate_cosine` computation:** `lib/embedding/cosine.ts` provides `cosineSimilarity()` and `parseEmbeddingJson()`; `orchestrate.ts` loads both embeddings from D1 and computes exact similarity at match time (falls back to `null` if missing).
- **Unified semantic search endpoints:** `POST /api/v1/search/candidates` and `POST /api/v1/search/repos` enable bidirectional search (role→candidates, role→repos, candidate→repos, repo→candidates) using dual-layer embeddings.
- **Role context embedding:** `buildAndStoreRoleEmbedding` fires best-effort when role discovery reaches `COMPLETE`, building `role_searchable_profile` from `job_description_md` and embedding via BGE-large-en-v1.5.

### Removed
- **Deprecated stage types:** Removed all dead stage types (`AI_COLLAB`, `PLANNING`, `VOICE`, `INGESTION`, `TECHNICAL`, `QUESTIONS`, `VOICE_INTERVIEW`) from frontend and backend.
- Locked to exactly 5 stage types: `SCREENING`, `CULTURAL`, `CODE_REVIEW`, `OPEN_SOURCE`, `LIVE_PANEL`.
- Aligned `workers/api/src/validation/stages.ts`, `src/lib/stageTemplates.ts`, `src/types/index.ts`, and all UI components.
- Removed `titleLower.includes(...)` fallback inference patterns in `StageIndexTab.tsx` and `StagePanel.tsx` — stages must have `stage_type` populated.
- Updated pipeline templates to use valid stage types only.
- Cleaned up unused lucide-react imports (Zap, Brain, Mic) from modified components.

### Changed
- `docs/vision.md`: Aligned with project brief — added product thesis, full vision reference, and guardrails
- `migration/PLAN.md`: Added Product Phases (P1–P5) section with 2026-04-22 decisions
- Documentation reorganization: unified navigation hub, split decisions into current/historical, extracted model routing, archived stale artifacts
- Deleted obsolete files: BUGS.md, TEST_ANALYSIS.md, TEST_STATUS.md, TODO.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/README.md, docs/handoffs/
- Deleted AWS Amplify artifacts: `amplify/`, `amplify_outputs.json`, `amplify.yml`
- Deleted Terraform infrastructure: `infra/` directory
- Archived CHANGELOG.md to docs/archive/CHANGELOG-historical.md, restarted fresh
- Moved DREAM.md → docs/vision.md (trimmed to product vision only)
- Moved docs/DRIFT_LOG.md → docs/ops/drift-log.md, docs/audits/ → docs/ops/audits/
- Created docs/ai/model-routing.md as single source of truth for AI routing
- Rewrote CLAUDE.md as pure navigation hub + agent instructions (no content duplication)
- Rewrote root README.md (50 lines)
- Updated internal links across migration docs, knowledge docs, and source files
