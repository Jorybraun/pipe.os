### [Unreleased]

#### Added
- **Roles & RoleCard UI Redesign**: Overhauled the main Roles listing and RoleCard components with a modern, horizontal brutalist aesthetic.
- **Candidate Card Redesign**: Updated CandidateKanbanCard and CandidateCard to match the horizontal brutalist aesthetic of the RoleCard. 
- **Glassmorphic UI & Drag-and-Drop**: Updated candidate cards to use the "mercury" glass variant and implemented draggable functionality between stages in the Overview Kanban view. 


- **AppSync Real-time Status**: Replaced container status polling with real-time push notifications via AppSync subscriptions for Dev Containers.
- **ECS Infrastructure**: Provisioned `pipe-dev-containers` cluster, `pipe-code-server:1` task definition, IAM execution role, and security group (port 8080) in us-west-2.
- **Dev Container Env Vars**: Wired ECS_CLUSTER_ARN, ECS_TASK_DEFINITION, ECS_SUBNET_IDS, ECS_SECURITY_GROUP_ID into `devContainerLaunch` and `devContainerStatus` Lambdas via `backend.ts`.
- **AWSJSON Parse Fix**: Added `coerceJson()` helper to `useDevContainerSession` to unwrap Amplify Gen 2 AWSJSON string responses before type-checking, surfacing real Lambda error messages.

#### Fixed
- **IAM `ecs:TagResource`**: Added `ecs:TagResource` to `devContainerLaunch` Lambda policy — required when passing a `tags:` array to `ECS.RunTask`.
- **Amplify Gen 2 argument extraction**: Fixed all three dev container Lambdas (`devContainerLaunch`, `devContainerDestroy`, `devContainerStatus`) — they were extracting arguments from the top-level event object instead of `event.arguments`. Amplify Gen 2 direct Lambda resolvers pass the full AppSync event envelope; mutation/query args are always nested under `event.arguments`.
- **IAM CloudWatch Logs**: Added `logs:CreateLogGroup` / `logs:CreateLogStream` / `logs:PutLogEvents` to `pipe-ecs-task-execution` role — tasks were stopping immediately at startup with `ResourceInitializationError`.
- **`ecsStatusBridge` upsert**: DynamoDB returns "The conditional request failed" (not "not found") when an item doesn't exist under Amplify's optimistic locking. The bridge was always silently failing to create sessions. Fixed by broadening the `isNotFound` check.
- **BOOTING stuck after page refresh**: Replaced the 120-second one-shot fallback in `useDevContainerSession` with a 5-second polling interval starting immediately on subscribe. AppSync subscriptions don't replay past events — if the container reached READY before the subscription was established (e.g. page refresh), the event was permanently missed. Polling catches up within 5 seconds.
- **ADR-016**: Documented dev container ECS Fargate + AppSync architecture decision; updated with confirmed-working validation notes, corrected rollback plan (5s polling not 120s timeout), and three bugs resolved during prototype phase.
- **ADR reference fix**: `DevContainerSandboxPage.tsx` architecture note corrected from `ADR-015` → `ADR-016`.

### `replace-polling-with-appsync` — Replace Container Status Polling with AppSync Subscriptions
- **Status**: 🟢 DONE
- **Changes**:
    - Replaced ECS container status polling with real-time push notifications using `DevContainerSession.onUpdate()`.
    - **`ecsStatusBridge` Lambda**: New bridge that routes EventBridge ECS Task State Change events to AppSync mutations.
    - **SSM Configuration**: Used SSM Parameter Store to break circular CDK dependencies between DynamoDB tables and Lambda handlers.
    - **Notification Engine**: Integrated DynamoDB Streams with a new `notificationStreamService` to decouple background processing from handlers.
    - **UI Enhancements**: Added brutalist/glassmorphic navigation for Roles and Sandbox; integrated `useDevContainerSession` hook with real-time status updates.
